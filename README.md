## Objectives of This Repository

- **Accelerate**: To extend PipeCD by distributed developers without touching the core code.
- **Reliable**: To provide a more sustainable and reliable location compared to individual repos.
- **Unified**: To gather developers and users into an unified place.


## Community

See ['Community and Development' of pipe-cd/pipecd](https://github.com/pipe-cd/pipecd?tab=readme-ov-file#community-and-development).

## Stability Levels

_This will be changed in the future since we are still defining the process._

1. **In Development**
   - Development is started.
   - Breaking changes are allowed.
2. **Alpha**
   - The plugin is ready for non-critical workloads. Not recommended for production use.
   - Breaking changes are allowed in minor or patch releases. Notice will be provided in the release notes.
3. **Beta**
   - The plugin is ready for non-critical production workloads.
   - Breaking changes are allowed in minor releases with prior notice and efforts to minimize them, but NOT allowed in patch releases unless under special circumstances.
4. **Stable**
   - The plugin is ready for production use including critical workloads.
   - Breaking changes are NOT allowed in minor or patch releases, unless under special circumstances.

TODO: We need to define **Unmaintained** and **Deprecated** levels.

### Criteria of Moving the Levels

_This will be changed in the future since we are still defining the process._

1. In Development -> Alpha
   - At least one active code owner.
   - There should be a docs for usage.
   - any other?
2. Alpha -> Beta
   - at least two active code owners.
   - any other?
3. Beta -> Stable
   - at least three active code owners.
   - and more...
